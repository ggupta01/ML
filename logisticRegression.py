# Logistic Regression
# It is used to estimate discrete values ( Binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false ) based on given set of independent variable(s). In simple words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logit function. Hence, it is also known as logit regression. Since, it predicts the probability, its output values lies between 0 and 1 (as expected).

#Import Library
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
#Assumed you have, X (predictor) and Y (target) for training data set and x_test(predictor) of test_dataset
# Create logistic regression object
model = LogisticRegression()
# Train the model using the training sets and check score
model.fit(X, y)
model.score(X, y)
#Equation coefficient and Intercept
print('Coefficient: \n', model.coef_)
print('Intercept: \n', model.intercept_)
#Predict Output
predicted= model.predict(x_test)
